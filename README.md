# DetectingVulnsV1
Detecting known vulnerabilities in a computer system typically involves checking the system against a list of known vulnerabilities, such as the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database.

# Disclaimer
Please note that this example is for illustrative purposes only and uses a simulated CVE database. In a real-world scenario, you would need to use a reputable and up-to-date CVE database and implement appropriate mechanisms to keep it updated. Additionally, detecting vulnerabilities and taking appropriate action to mitigate them should always be done in compliance with legal and ethical guidelines, and with proper authorization from the system owner or administrator.

# Compiling the program
``gcc detection.c -o vulndetection``

# Executing the program
``./vulndetection`` or ``./detection``
